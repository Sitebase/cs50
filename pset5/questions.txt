0.  What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

This is the longest word that is in the large dictionary (45 characters).

1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

I can be used to get information about resource utilization of the current process.

2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?

16

3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?

This way the function knows where in memory it needs to write the data so we can access it later on with that pointer.

4.  Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

Depending on the number of arguments we now the position of the text to validate is in position 2 or 1.
Now that we know which file we want to check at line 60 we open the file for reading (r) and store the pointer in a variable.
At 61 we do a sanity check to make sure the file could be opened.
Before we start our loop we need to create a few variables. One for keeping track of the index for keeping track of the index were we should put the leter.
Another variable is `word` which will function as a buffer to read the words letter per letter from the file. We give this variable a fixed size of the maximum word length in the dictionary +1 for the termination character (\0).

Now we start our loop and read the first character of the file.
If the character is a letter we add it to our buffer (word) and now the while lop...

5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const?
